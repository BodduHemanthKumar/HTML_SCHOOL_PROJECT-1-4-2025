<center><h2 id="about"><b>ABOUT US</b></h2>
<p>St.Joseph's International School is an English Medium, all-girls school. The institution was established in the year 1871 with the sole objective of helping the weaker sections of society. This school welcomed the orphans and wards of the poor and needy. The sisters of St. Joseph's a religious Congregation, were committed towards this holy cause. Today, it has opened its doors to all girls who are looking to have a quality education in a nurturing environment. The tremendous effort of the management is well-reflected in the growing strength of the school since then. From just 25 orphans in 1871 to a strength of 1000s of students studying in different curriculums of ICSE and SSC, St. Joseph's International School has indeed carved a niche for itself in the Hyderabad education fraternity. Over the decades, the school has evolved and matured in its identity, by adapting to the latest methodology of education. At St.Joseph's, focus is laid on building the character of the younger generation and empowering young girls so that they evolve as women of substance.</p></center>
